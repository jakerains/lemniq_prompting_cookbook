# 8. Glossary

Brief definitions for common prompt-engineering terms.

* **Temperature:** Controls randomness in model outputs. Higher values yield more creative but less predictable responses.
* **Top-p:** Limits sampling to the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability does not exceed this value.
* **Chain-of-Thought:** Technique where the model shows its step-by-step reasoning before the final answer.
* **Context Window:** Total number of tokens the model can consider from the prompt and conversation history.
* **Token:** A chunk of text (like a word or subword) that the model processes individually.
