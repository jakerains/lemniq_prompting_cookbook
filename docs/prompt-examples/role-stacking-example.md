# Role Stacking Example

This example demonstrates the role stacking technique in action, showing both the prompt and the AI's response.

## The Prompt

```prompt
You are both a senior financial analyst AND a creative storyteller. 

As a financial analyst: Analyze the implications of rising interest rates on the housing market in 2024, focusing on affordability and mortgage applications.

As a storyteller: After your analysis, illustrate these concepts through a short story (max 150 words) about a first-time homebuyer facing these market conditions.

Present your response in two clearly labeled sections.
```

## The Response

*For accessibility, the text of the response is also provided below:*

### Financial Analyst Perspective

Rising interest rates in 2024 are significantly impacting the housing market in several ways:

1. **Decreased Affordability**: With mortgage rates hovering between 6-7% (up from historic lows of 2-3% in 2020-2021), borrowing costs have increased substantially. A $400,000 mortgage at 3% would cost approximately $1,686 monthly, while at 6.5% it costs about $2,528 - a 50% increase in monthly payments.

2. **Reduced Mortgage Applications**: Mortgage application volumes have declined approximately 20-25% year-over-year, as higher rates discourage new buyers and refinancing activity.

3. **Market Cooldown**: Home price appreciation has slowed considerably, with some markets experiencing modest price corrections of 5-10%.

4. **Shift in Buyer Demographics**: First-time homebuyers are being disproportionately affected, with their market share dropping to approximately 30% of purchases, down from the historical average of 40%.

5. **Inventory Build-up**: Housing inventory is gradually increasing as homes remain on the market longer, shifting some leverage back to buyers after years of extreme seller advantage.

### Storyteller Perspective

**"The Number That Changed Everything"**

Maya refreshed the mortgage calculator again, hoping the numbers would somehow rearrange themselves. They didn't.

"Two years ago, we would have qualified easily," she sighed, showing her husband Elijah the monthly payment estimate—nearly $800 higher than what they'd budgeted for the modest three-bedroom they'd toured yesterday.

Their realtor, Diane, nodded sympathetically. "It's the same story everywhere. That 3-point rate jump changed everything."

Maya remembered her parents' stories about 18% rates in the 1980s, but that was abstract history—this was her life, now.

"We have options," Diane offered. "Smaller homes in the next county over, seller concessions, or waiting for more inventory."

Elijah squeezed Maya's hand. "Or we save another year."

Maya closed her laptop. The dream wasn't dead—just deferred by a number on a screen that felt very, very personal.

## Analysis of Effectiveness

This example showcases how role stacking can provide both analytical depth and emotional resonance:

1. The financial analyst role delivers factual, data-driven analysis with specific percentages and market trends
2. The storyteller role humanizes these abstract concepts through a relatable character experiencing the market challenges
3. Together, they create a more comprehensive understanding than either perspective alone could provide

The clear separation between sections maintains clarity while allowing each role to shine in its specific domain of expertise.

## When to Use This Approach

This role stacking approach works particularly well when:

- You need to explain complex topics to diverse audiences
- You want to balance data-driven analysis with human impact
- You're creating educational content that needs to engage emotionally
- You're preparing materials that need to appeal to both analytical and narrative thinkers
