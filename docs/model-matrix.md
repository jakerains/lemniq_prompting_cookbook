## OpenAI Models

| Model | Context Window | Input Price | Output Price | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **GPT-4o** | 128K tokens | $5.00 / 1M tokens | $15.00 / 1M tokens | Multimodal, reasoning, instruction-following | Complex reasoning, technical tasks, creative content |
| **GPT-4o mini** | 128K tokens | $0.15 / 1M tokens | $0.60 / 1M tokens | Cost-effective, good reasoning | Day-to-day prompting, content generation |
| **GPT-3.5 Turbo** | 16K tokens | $0.50 / 1M tokens | $1.50 / 1M tokens | Speed, cost-efficiency | Simple tasks, high-volume applications |

## Anthropic Models

| Model | Context Window | Input Price | Output Price | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Claude 3 Opus** | 200K tokens | $15.00 / 1M tokens | $75.00 / 1M tokens | Reasoning, nuance, instruction following | Complex analysis, specialized tasks |
| **Claude 3 Sonnet** | 200K tokens | $3.00 / 1M tokens | $15.00 / 1M tokens | Balance of quality and cost | Professional applications |
| **Claude 3 Haiku** | 200K tokens | $0.25 / 1M tokens | $1.25 / 1M tokens | Speed, efficiency | Quick responses, simple tasks |

## Meta Models (Through APIs)

| Model | Context Window | Input Price | Output Price | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Llama 3 (70B)** | 8K tokens | Varies by provider | Varies by provider | Open ecosystem, customizable | Self-hosting, privacy-sensitive use cases |
| **Llama 3 (8B)** | 8K tokens | Varies by provider | Varies by provider | Lightweight, efficient | Edge deployment, lower complexity tasks |

## Cohere Models

| Model | Context Window | Input Price | Output Price | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Command R+** | 128K tokens | $5.00 / 1M tokens | $15.00 / 1M tokens | Search, RAG capabilities | Enterprise knowledge applications |
| **Command R** | 128K tokens | $1.00 / 1M tokens | $5.00 / 1M tokens | Cost-effective retrieval | Document processing, search |

## Cost Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Content Generation with GPT-4o

Creating 10 blog posts (1,500 words each) would require approximately:
- Input: ~3,000 tokens per blog (prompt + instructions) = 30,000 tokens total
- Output: ~2,000 tokens per blog = 20,000 tokens total
- Cost: (30,000 × $0.000005) + (20,000 × $0.000015) = $0.15 + $0.30 = **$0.45 total**

### Example 2: Data Analysis with Claude 3 Sonnet

Analyzing 50 customer feedback reports:
- Input: ~100,000 tokens (all reports + instructions)
- Output: ~20,000 tokens (analysis)
- Cost: (100,000 × $0.000003) + (20,000 × $0.000015) = $0.30 + $0.30 = **$0.60 total**

## Token Estimation Guide

As a rough guideline for English text:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ¾ of a word
- 1,500 words ≈ 2,000 tokens
- 1 page (500 words) ≈ 650-700 tokens

## Tips for Optimizing Costs

1. **Use Smaller Context Windows When Possible**: Don't use a 32K or 128K context window if you only need a few thousand tokens.
2. **Choose the Right Model for the Task**: Use simpler, cheaper models for straightforward tasks.
3. **Batch Similar Requests**: When processing multiple similar items, batch them when possible.
4. **Cache Responses**: Implement response caching for frequently requested content.
5. **Optimize Prompts**: Remove unnecessary text from your prompts to reduce token count.

## Notes

- Prices and capabilities are subject to change. Check the official documentation for the most current information.
- Many providers offer volume discounts for enterprise usage.
- Free tiers and credits are often available for development and testing.
