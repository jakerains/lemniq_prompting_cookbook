# Chain-of-Thought on Demand

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a technique that explicitly instructs ChatGPT to show its step-by-step reasoning process before providing a final answer. This approach significantly improves accuracy for complex reasoning tasks and makes the AI's thought process transparent to users.

## How It Works

By asking ChatGPT to "think aloud" through a problem, you help it organize its reasoning and avoid logical errors. The model breaks down complex problems into manageable steps, solving each part before synthesizing a final answer.

### Basic Pattern

```prompt
[Question or problem]

Show your step-by-step reasoning process before giving your final answer.
```

### Advanced Pattern

```prompt
[Question or problem]

Show your step-by-step reasoning process inside triple backticks before giving your final answer. Consider multiple approaches to this problem and explain why you select your chosen method.
```

## Example: Financial Analysis

```prompt
What would be the final value of a $10,000 investment that grows by 7% annually for 5 years, with an additional $1,000 added at the beginning of each year?

Show step-by-step reasoning inside triple backticks before giving the final answer.
```

## Example: Decision Making

```prompt
Should our startup focus on increasing user acquisition or improving retention next quarter given these metrics:
- Current monthly acquisition: 5,000 users (costs $20 per user)
- Current monthly churn: 20%
- Lifetime value per user: $120
- We have $150,000 for marketing

Think through this step-by-step, considering ROI, long-term growth, and cash flow implications. Show your reasoning before making a recommendation.
```

## When to Use Chain-of-Thought

- For complex mathematical or logical problems
- When accuracy is critical and errors would be costly
- When you need to verify the AI's reasoning process
- For educational purposes to show how to approach problems
- When debugging incorrect responses from previous prompts

## Benefits of Chain-of-Thought

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces logical errors and improves results on complex tasks
2. **Transparency**: Makes the AI's reasoning visible, building trust and understanding
3. **Educational Value**: Demonstrates problem-solving approaches that users can learn from
4. **Easier Verification**: Allows you to spot exactly where reasoning went wrong
5. **Better Troubleshooting**: Helps identify misconceptions or prompt issues

## Implementation Tips

- Specify the format for the reasoning (e.g., numbered steps, inside code blocks)
- For critical applications, always use CoT rather than relying on direct answers
- Combine with examples (few-shot prompting) for even better results
- For multi-part problems, request separate reasoning sections for each part
