# Multi-Agent Prompt Orchestration

Multi-agent prompt orchestration involves coordinating multiple specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and objectives, to solve complex problems collaboratively. This approach breaks down tasks into specialized components handled by purpose-built agents that pass information between each other.

## How It Works

Each agent has a specific role, expertise, and goal within the broader workflow. The orchestration defines when and how agents hand off tasks to each other, creating a pipeline of specialized processing that produces more refined results than a single general-purpose prompt.

### Basic Pattern

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {"id": "agent_1", "role": "[Role Description]", "goal": "[Specific Objective]"},
    {"id": "agent_2", "role": "[Role Description]", "goal": "[Specific Objective]"}
  ],
  "handoff": "agent_1->agent_2",
  "task_flow": "[Description of information flow between agents]"
}
```

## Example: Content Creation Pipeline

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {"id": "researcher", "role": "Research Specialist", "goal": "Gather factual information on [topic]"},
    {"id": "outliner", "role": "Content Strategist", "goal": "Organize research into cohesive structure"},
    {"id": "writer", "role": "Creative Writer", "goal": "Craft engaging content from the outline"}
  ],
  "handoff": "researcher->outliner->writer",
  "task_flow": "Researcher provides factual bullet points to Outliner, who creates a structured outline, which Writer transforms into polished content."
}
```

### Implementation Example

1. **Agent 1 – Research Specialist**  
   ```prompt
   You are a Research Specialist. Find five key facts about [topic], focusing on [specific aspect].
   Present information as concise bullet points with attribution to reliable sources.
   ```

2. **Agent 2 – Content Strategist**  
   ```prompt
   You are a Content Strategist. Using these researched points:
   [Agent 1's output]
   
   Create a coherent outline with logical flow, identifying knowledge gaps and suggesting additional sections.
   ```

3. **Agent 3 – Creative Writer**  
   ```prompt
   You are a Creative Writer specializing in [content type]. Transform this outline:
   [Agent 2's output]
   
   Into engaging [content type] for [target audience], maintaining factual accuracy while adding storytelling elements.
   ```

## Example: Problem-Solving Team

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {"id": "problem_analyzer", "role": "Critical Thinker", "goal": "Break down complex problem"},
    {"id": "solution_generator", "role": "Creative Solver", "goal": "Generate potential solutions"},
    {"id": "evaluator", "role": "Rational Evaluator", "goal": "Assess solutions objectively"}
  ],
  "handoff": "problem_analyzer->solution_generator->evaluator",
  "task_flow": "Analyzer deconstructs problem into components, Generator creates multiple solution approaches, Evaluator critiques and ranks solutions."
}
```

## When to Use Multi-Agent Orchestration

- For complex workflows requiring different types of expertise
- When you need both creative and analytical perspectives
- To implement checks and balances in AI reasoning
- For tasks with clear sequential stages that benefit from specialization
- When a single prompt becomes too unwieldy or unfocused

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Orchestration

1. **Specialization**: Each agent excels at a specific task
2. **Improved Output Quality**: Multiple processing stages refine the result
3. **Easier Debugging**: Identify which agent/stage is causing issues
4. **Modular Development**: Update individual agents without redesigning the entire system
5. **Clearer Reasoning**: Each agent's limited scope produces more focused thinking

## Implementation Tips

- Start with a simple two-agent system before building more complex workflows
- Ensure clear, structured outputs from each agent that can serve as inputs to the next
- Consider implementing human review at critical handoff points
- Document each agent's purpose, inputs, and expected outputs
- Test with a variety of inputs to ensure the system handles edge cases
