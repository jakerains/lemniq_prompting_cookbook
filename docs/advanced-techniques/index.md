# Advanced Techniques

This section covers more sophisticated prompting techniques that can help you tackle complex use cases and get higher quality results from ChatGPT.

## Techniques Overview

The advanced techniques covered in this section include:

1. [Role Stacking](./role-stacking.md) - Give ChatGPT multiple hats to wear simultaneously
2. [Tool Calling (Actions)](./tool-calling.md) - Enable ChatGPT to use external tools and APIs
3. [Chain-of-Thought on Demand](./chain-of-thought.md) - Get step-by-step reasoning before answers
4. [System-Prompt Guards](./system-prompt-guards.md) - Implement safety measures for applications
5. [Multi-Agent Prompt Orchestration](./multi-agent-orchestration.md) - Coordinate specialized AI agents

Each technique builds upon the fundamental prompting principles covered earlier, adding more sophisticated control mechanisms to handle complex requirements.

## When to Use Advanced Techniques

While the fundamentals will serve you well for many use cases, consider using these advanced techniques when:

- You need more nuanced, targeted responses
- You're building applications with ChatGPT
- You're working with complex or sensitive topics
- You need to ensure reliability and safety
- Basic prompts aren't giving you the quality or control you need

## Getting Started
