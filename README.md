## About This Cookbook
**Who it’s for:** Busy founders, marketers, and non‑technical teams who need AI to *do* things—not just chat about them.

**How to use it:** Copy a recipe, swap in your details, iterate twice, profit.

> *Rule #1:* A prompt is a conversation starter, not a one‑and‑done incantation.
