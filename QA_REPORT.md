Date: 2025-05-17

## Spell-Check Results
- Reviewed README.md, fundamentals.md, advanced_techniques.md, troubleshooting.md, quick_reference.md, resources.md and all files under `recipes/`.
- No spelling errors were found in any file.
- Due to network restrictions, package installation for automated spell-checking was unavailable, so verification was done manually.

## Consistency Review
- All instances of the product name use the **lemnIQ** styling as required.
- Markdown code fences are balanced in every file.
- Tables render correctly and headings follow sequential numbering.
- No trailing whitespace detected across files.

## Conclusion
The repository's Markdown content is free from typographical mistakes and maintains consistent style and structure. No edits were necessary.
